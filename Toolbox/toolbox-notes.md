# Data Scientist's Toolbox

### Types of analysis 
- Description: describe data, e.g., census data—just reporting. 
- Exploration: find connections, define further work. 
- Inference: (and uncertainty) the most common goal of statistics. 
- Prediction: use dataset to predict the properties of another. 
- Causal: study effect of changing a single parameter in complex systems. 
- Mechanistic: as above, but exact, not on-average, e.g., via equations. 

The data should follow the question; ‘Bigness' of data is in the eye of the beholder.

### Experimental design
- Have a plan for data and code sharing.
  - The Leek group guide to data sharing. 
- Confounding: don’t confuse the crucial parameter.
- Randomise people to groups. 
- Stratifying: use a potential confounder over different parameters.
