# This dashboard plots consumption (kWh) and load (kVAh) for a 24-hour span, 
#  at 15'cadence, on a day selected by the user, or the average of all days
#  in a specified range. It displays four aggregation and summary statistics
#  to contract against the overall data set. 
# 

# This code is a simple wrapper for the ui.R and server.R file required to 
#  establish a Shiny application. All it does is to runApp()
# 

library(shiny)
